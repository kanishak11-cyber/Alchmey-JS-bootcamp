// Add Last
// In the last stage, we added a node to the front of the list. Now it's time to add one to the back of the list. As you might imagine, this one is a bit trickier.

// We can divide it into the same two scenarios again:

// No Existing Head Node
// If there is no existing head node, this actually works just the same as the addFirst logic.

// Since there's no other nodes, whether you are adding first or last boils down to the same logicâ€¦ A new head node:

// No Head

// Existing Head Node
// It's a bit trickier with an existing head node. Let's say we have a list of size 2:

// Add Last

// We need to start at the head and continue down the list until we reach a point in the list where there is no next node. Once we reach this point, we set the next to our new node.

//  Your Goal: Add Last
// Create a method addLast on LinkedList which takes a node and adds it to the end of our linked list.
