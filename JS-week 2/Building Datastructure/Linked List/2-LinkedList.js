// Linked List
// Now let's work on our Linked List implementation! In this stage we'll work on the new file LinkedList.js.

// We need to keep track of a head. This is the first node in the linked list.

// The head will keep a reference to the next node which will keep a reference to its next nodeâ€¦ and so on until the end of the list.

// Linked List

//  Your Goal: Linked List Constructor
// Add a constructor function to the LinkedList in the new file LinkedList.js.

// The linked list should have a head property that is set to null by default.

// Example:

// const linkedList = new LinkedList();

// console.log(linkedList.head); // null

class LinkedList {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null;
    }
}
