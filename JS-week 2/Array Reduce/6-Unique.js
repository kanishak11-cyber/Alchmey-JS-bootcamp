// All Unique
// If you made it this far in the tutorial you really know what you're doing with array reduce! AMAZING.

// One last idea we want to introduce to you.

// In the reduce function you will also have access to the index of the element in each iteration. For example:

// ['a','b','c'].reduce((a,c,i) => {
//     console.log(c,i); 
// });
// The logs will be:

// a, 0
// b, 1
// c, 2
// This code exercise illustrates a situation where the index really comes in handy!

// We want to return whether or not the entire array is unique.

// So, why does the index help?

// Think about this:

// const arr = [1,2,3,1];
// console.log(arr.indexOf(1)); // 0
// The index of 1 in arr is the first index that it shows up at. It completely ignores the index 3 where 1 also exists.

// If we are ever at an iteration where arr.indexOf(currentValue) !== index, we know that the number must exist somewhere else earlier in the array!

//  Your Goal: Are all Unique?
// Finish the allUnique function. Return true if all the elements are unique and false if they are not.

function allUnique(numbers){
    return numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue, index) => {
        if (numbers.indexOf(currentValue) !== index) {
            accumulator = false
        }
        return accumulator
    }, true)
}
