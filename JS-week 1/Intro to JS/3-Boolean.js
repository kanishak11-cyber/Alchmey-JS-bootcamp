// Booleans
// Great work! So far you've stored numbers inside of variables. Well, surprise, there's more types of values we can store inside variables!

// We can also store a boolean. Weird name, huh? Don't worry, a boolean is actually quite simple. It can only be one of two values: true or false. Let's store a false value:

// const loggedIn = false;
// Is the user logged in the above line? The false value indicates that they are not.

// Let's store a true value:

// const purchasedItem = true;
// Did the user purchase the item? Yup!

//  Notice that variables in JavaScript tend to be lowerCamelCase.

//  Your Goal: Create two boolean variables
// Create two boolean variables a and b. Store true in one and false in the other.

const a = true
const b= false

module.exports = { a, b }
