// Comments
// Comments are an important part of writing programs! When we write a program, we want to let other programmers know about certain choices we made.

// Be a good friend to your fellow coders who may see your code one day. Write good comments! 

// It's also important to come up with good variable names:

// const value = 42;
// const price = 42;
// Both of these variables hold 42, although price is more descriptive!

// We can do even better using comments:

// this is price in U.S. Dollars
//const price = 42;
//In this example, we use double forward slash // for comments. JavaScript engines will not execute this line. Comments are only written for humans to better understand the program.

//We can also write multi-line comments:

/* The price of all of our items
   Denominated in U.S. Dollars  */
//const price = 42;
// Here
 /* indicates the beginning of the comment and */ 
//  indicates the end. This comment can span many lines.

//  Your Goal: Fix the Comments!
// Somebody wrote some comments in the program, but forgot to use the correct syntax!

// Fix the comments on line 1 so they still appear in the program and will not be executed.

//all shoes are on sale this week!
const shoesCost = 49;

module.exports = shoesCost;
