// Linking Prototypes
// What would happen if we tried to call .move function on our Circle instance like the code below?

// const circle = new Circle(5,10,15);

// circle.move(1,1); // what happens?
// If you're not sure, you can try it out by running the test cases now! 

// You'll likely see an error: TypeError: circle.move is not a function. 

// Even though we use the Shape function to store the variables x and y on our Circle, we did not link to the Shape prototype!

// This is where the awesome Object.create method comes in:

// Circle.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype);
// Now our Circle prototype inherits methods from the Shape Prototype! Any new circle will have a move method.

//  Object.create is used to link our prototypes within the prototype chain.

//  Your Goal: Link the prototypes
// Use Object.create to link Circle.prototype to Shape.prototype.

// This will ensure that any methods on Shape.prototype will also become available on new Circle instances. For instance, we'll be able to use circle.move(1,1); just like we did on the shape instance!

const Shape = require('./Shape');
Circle.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype);
function Circle(x, y, radius) {
    Shape.call(this,x,y /* pass arguments to shape */);
    // store radius on this
    this.radius = radius
}

module.exports = Circle;
