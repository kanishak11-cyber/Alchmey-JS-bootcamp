// Default Operator
// In the last stage we referred to || as the Logical OR operator.

// This operator is also sometimes referred to as the default operator, due to its behavior with truthy and falsey values.

// Take, for example:

// console.log("" || "Something Else"); // Something Else
// The empty string "" is a falsey value, so || will take the second value in this operation.

// This can be pretty useful with variables! We can use this to create a default message if one is not defined:

// const message = WELCOME_MESSAGE || "Hello there!";
//  Here message is guaranteed a truthy value even if WELCOME_MESSAGE is empty.

// And it's not just limited to empty strings either:

// const age = user.age || 99;
//  If user.age is undefined or 0 we will default to 99. For that matter user.age could be any falsey value and it would default to 99.

//  Can you think of any other good examples for default values?

//  Your Goal: Handle an Undefined
// The double function here is almost complete! We also want double to be able to handle when x is undefined.

// Example:

// const result = double(); 

// console.log(result); // 0
// If no value is provided for x, return 0.

//  Be careful with order of operations here! In the expression x || y * z the y * z will evaluate before x || y unless you use a parenthesis: (x || y) * z.

function double(x) {

    if (x === undefined) {
        return 0
    }
    return x * 2;
}
