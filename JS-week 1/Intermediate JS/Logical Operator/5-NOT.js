// NOT Operator
// The final logical operator we will discuss is the ! operator. Commonly referred to as the NOT or negation operator.

// This operator will flip true and false:

// console.log(!true); // false
// console.log(!false); // true
// It will also flip truthy and falsey values:

// console.log(!2); // false
// console.log(!undefined); // true
//  If you apply the negation operator to a truthy or falsey value twice, you'll wind up with the corresponding boolean value. Since 2 is a truthy value, !!2 will evaluate to true.

//  Your Goal: Car Crossing the Bridge
// There's a river that runs right between two towns. In order for cars to cross the river, we built a bridge!

// XOR

// Trouble is, there's only room for 1 car to cross the bridge at a time. This means that if both cars were to be crossing at the same time, neither would be able to cross.

// Complete the carCrossing function to return true if and only if one car is crossing.

//  The logical term for this situation is an "Exclusive OR". In other words, it is only true if exactly 1 of the terms are true.
