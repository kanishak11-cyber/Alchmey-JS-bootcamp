// Guard Operator
// We learned that || can be referred to as the Logical OR operator or the default operator.

// Similarily, the && operator can be referred to as the Logical AND operator or the guard operator!

// We can use the operator to guard against run-time exceptions (or errors) when dealing with falsey values. 

// Let's see some examples:

// const user = { name: 'bob' }
// console.log(user && user.name); // bob

// const user2 = undefined;
// console.log(user2 && user2.name); // undefined
// Notice how in the first example we successfully retrieve the user's name, while the second example returns undefined.

// In the second example, if we tried to retrieve this property directly, we would hit a run-time exception:

// const user2 = undefined;
// console.log(user2.name);
// Trying to log user2.name right here would result in an uncaught error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined.

//  Uncaught errors are bad! They'll stop our code execution. This could result in some really ugly errors for users.

//  Your Goal: Guard it
// The function friendName currently retrieves the name property from the friend.

// The problem is, sometimes friend is undefined. When this is the case, let's return undefined without throwing an exception.

function friendName(friend) {
    if (friend === undefined) {
        return friend
    }
    return friend.name;
}

module.exports = friendName;
