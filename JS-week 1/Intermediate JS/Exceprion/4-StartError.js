// JavaScript Errors
// There are many errors that can be thrown by the JavaScript language itself.

// Here's an example of an error thrown by JavaScript:

// const x = 3;

// x();
// In this example, x is a number and cannot be invoked! This will throw a TypeError.

//  There are several different types of errors thrown by JavaScript: TypeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError, and RangeError. You can learn about these different types of errors and the situations in which they occur in details.

//  Your Goal: Start an Error
// Pick an error from one of the situations mentioned in details. Write code that will make one of these errors occur.

// As long as any of the error types mentioned above are thrown, the test cases will pass.


function startError() {
    throw new SyntaxError('')
}

module.exports = startError;
