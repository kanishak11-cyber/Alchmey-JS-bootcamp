// Objects
// In JavaScript, objects start with a open curly-brace { and end with a close curly-brace }. We can put key-value pairs in between these braces.

// Let's take a look at a simple object:

// const team = {
//     name: "Mets",
//     wins: 86,
//     inPlayoffs: false,
// };
// In this object team, we have three keys: name, wins and inPlayoffs

// The value associated with name is "Mets", with wins is 86 and with inPlayoffs is false

//  Your Goal: Create a Pizza Order
// Let's create an object representing a pizza order!

// In the order object, add the following three keys with values accordingly:

// pizzas - Any number greater than zero.
// extraCheese - A boolean. Either true or false.
// deliveryInstructions - Any string of instructions.

const order = {
  pizzas: 1,
  extraCheese: true,
  deliveryInstructions: "make it uickq",
};

module.exports = order;
