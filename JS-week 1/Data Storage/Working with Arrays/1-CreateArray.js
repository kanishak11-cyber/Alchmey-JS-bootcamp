// Arrays
// In JavaScript, when we want to store a list of elements we use an Array.

// An array starts with an open square bracket [ and ends with a closed square bracket ]. The elements inside the array are separated by a comma ,.

// Here are some examples of arrays filled with primary types:

// const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// const booleans = [true, false, true, true];
// const strings = ["happy", "go", "lucky"];
// We can also store arrays within arrays! Referred to as a nested array.

// const nested = [[1, 2, [1, 2]], 2];
//  In this example, the top-level nested array has two elements: an array [1, 2, [1, 2]]and the element 2.

//  Your Goal: Fill the Array
// Fill the array with the numbers 1, 2 and 3 in any order you choose!

const array = [1,2,3] // <-- create an array here!

module.exports = array;
