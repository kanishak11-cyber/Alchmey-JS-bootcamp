// Intro To JavaScript
//  Hey there! Welcome to Intro To JavaScript.

//  Variables
//  A key feature of programming languages is the ability to store some value for later use. 
//  We store values in something called a variable. 

// Let's see what this looks like in a line of code:

// const a = 3

// In the line above a is our variable. The number 3 is the value we'd like to store in a. 
// Finally, the word const is a keyword use to declare a as a constant value. 
// We can access the value 3 in a future line of code by referring to the variable a:

// const a = 3

// module.exports = a

// In this case, we are exporting the value a so other files can access it. 
// Don&apos;t worry too much about module.exports for now, we will discuss this in future stages!

//  Your Goal: Store Number in a
// Your goal on this stage is to simply give the variable a some number value. It could be any number. Perhaps it's your favorite number, maybe it's a floating point number 12.5 or perhaps it's a negative number -22! It's all up to you. You'll do this by typing a number on the right-hand side of the const a = statement.

// Once you have set the number, click "Run Tests" to move forward!

const a = 3
const b = 6
module.exports = a,b;
