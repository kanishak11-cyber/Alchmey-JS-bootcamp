// Dialog Callback
// For this stage, we will create a callback that will be invoked by user interaction. Compare this usage to the previous stage where our callback was fired once an alotted amount of time had passed.

// Imagine we have a basic dialog component for our web application. This Dialog component will use the JavaScript class, so we can create a new instance of the dialog whenever we need one.

//  Your Goal: Complete Dialog Functions
// We're going to write two functions for our dialog component:

// onClose - This method will take a callback function as an argument and store it on our Dialog instance.
// close - This function will be used to close the dialog. When we close the dialog, we'll want to call the callbackFunction.
// In practice, when we want to use the Dialog component, we could wire up some logic to execute when a specific dialog is closed. For example, we could refresh the data on the page:

// const dialog = new Dialog();

// dialog.onClose(function() {
//     // refresh data on the page to reflect state 
//     // changes made inside of the dialog
//     refreshData(); 
// });
//  Remember in the last stage the callback was invoked asynchronously by setTimeout. This callback is similar! The main difference here is the close function is kicked off by the user when they click out of the dialog.

class Dialog{
    constructor(){
        this.callbackFunction = null;
    }
    onClose(callbackFunction){
        this.callbackFunction = callbackFunction;
    }
    close(){
        this.callbackFunction();
    }
    
}
