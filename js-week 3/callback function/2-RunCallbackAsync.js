// Asynchronous Callback
// In the last stage, we discussed how callbacks are run at a specific time when they are passed to another function. Typically, this makes them extremely useful for asynchronous programming.

// For web-applications, where JavaScript is especially prevalent, asynchronous callbacks can be helpful in several scenarios:

// AJAX requests to the server
// Waiting for a user response
// Animations
// A simple example for asynchronous code is to use the web API setTimeout which will run code after a set amount of time:

// setTimeout(function callback() {
//     // the code to run after 1000 milliseconds
// }, 1000);

// // code down here runs synchronously (before the callback)
// In setTimeout, we give it a callback to run after a period of time (in milliseconds). The first argument to the function is the callback and the second argument is the number of milliseconds to wait before running the callback function.

//  See the full documention of setTimeout on MDN.

//  Your Goal: Make Run Callback Asynchronous
// Let's modify runCallback to make callbackFunction run asynchronously.

// Just like the example above, use setTimeout and invoke callbackFunction 1000 milliseconds (1 second) after runCallback has been called.

function runCallback(callbackFunction){
    setTimeout(callbackFunction, 1000);
    
}
