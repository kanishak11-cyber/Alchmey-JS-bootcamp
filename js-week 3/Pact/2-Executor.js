// The Executor
// The function that gets passed in to the promise constructor is often referred to as the executor function:

// new Promise(function executor(resolve, reject) {
//     // inside the executor function!
// });
//  Let's add this functionality to our Pact!

//  Your Goal: Writing the Constructor
// We'll need to declare a new constructor on Pact. This constructor will take an executor function as it's only argument.

// The executor function should be called immediately from the constructor with two arguments of it's own, both of which are new functions.

// Let's take a closer look at the executor function example and consider how we can achieve this functionality.

// For Pact it should look like this:

// const pact = new Pact((resolve, reject) => {
//     console.log(typeof resolve); // function
//     console.log(typeof reject); // function
// });
//  If you can make the above comments true, you'll pass the tests! You'll need to ensure that both resolve and reject are functions passed to the executor.

class Pact {
    
}
